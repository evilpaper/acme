# ACME

## About

A fictional SaaS used as stand-in for example app built using Next.js. Used to trying out different concepts and solution.

The starting code follows Vercels course Learn Next.js. You find the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

## Running a development server

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then, start a local development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

**Note:** Unlike create-react-app, we need to run the `dev` command, not `start`. The `start` command is used to run a _production_ server.
